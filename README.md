This is a Payment website built using React.js and also accepts the front end details on the backend using Firebase Cloud firestore.

cd payment_website
npm run build -It allows you to perform any necessary building/prep tasks for your project, prior to it being used in another project.

I have also used component to make my code reuseable and easy to understand basically
I have also managed my state by using useState which is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components.
React Router is also included in the project- it allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates.
